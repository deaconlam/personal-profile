        <p>When I was in elementary school, I started to develop an interest in computers and coding. 
            I knew I wanted to explore this topic more!<br><br>Since I got into Richmond Secondary School, 
            I’ve had even more opportunities to take computer-related courses, such as computer programming. 
            After studying web development in Grade 9, I’m now back in the classroom, 
            as a peer tutor for the exact same course I took three years ago! <br><br>As a side project, 
            I recently started teaching myself how to develop iOS apps. It’s a challenging but rewarding process!
            <br><br>Also, thanks to the skills and knowledge I built throughout the years, I made this website from scratch without using website building tools like Wix and Weebly!</p>
